👋🤡 Gabriel here.

I'm a self-taught programmer, and your *[average Neovim enthusiast](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/5_circus_clowns_LCCN2002718921.jpg)*. In my spare time, I particularly enjoy making tools and small games that run on the **command line**. Right now, I'm interested in gaining more experience in application and web development.

------

***Currently practicing:***
* Rust

***Versed in:***
* Python
* C
* Nim
* Bash 
* Javascript, HTML and CSS

***I do not like:***
* C++
> Everyday I look into the mirror and try to convince myself to make peace with C++, when clearly [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/amvAORo_460s.jpg) himself is testing me by forcing me to create a whole-ass void function just to use `.split()` 💞️

------

I’m looking to collaborate on anything **app** or **web dev** related, though I'll likely be more of support for back-end related stuff rather than front-end.  

For anything urgent, you can drop me a message on [telegram](https://t.me/gongahkia) or on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-ong-a87022208/).
