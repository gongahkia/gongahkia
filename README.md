# Good morning [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqWqSxJtBDw&ab_channel=klantskalle)

👋 Gabriel here.

I'm the *average Neovim enthusiast* 🤡, and particulary enjoy making tools and small games that run on the **command line**.

I’m interested in application and web development. 👀 

Currently practicing:
* C++

Versed in: 
* Python
* C
* Nim
* Bash 
* Javascript, HTML and CSS

> Deluding myself into believing C++ is a sustainable language when I have to create a whole ass void function to use `.split()` 👹 

I’m looking to collaborate on anything app or web dev related, though I'll likely be more of support for back-end related work than front-end. 💞️ 

For anything urgent, you can drop me a message on linkedin.
