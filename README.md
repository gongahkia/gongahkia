- 👋 Gabriel here.
- 👀 I’m interested in not seeing error logs in VSC for once. With C++ though, there is no chance.
- 🌱 I’m currently practicing Python, Julia, C++, HTML, and CSS. Javascript, Rust, Perl, and Ruby are all on the backburner for now.
- 🤡 Deluding myself into believing that C++ will make me a better programmer when I have to create a whole ass void function to use .split()
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that requires mild debugging.
- 📫 You can reach me on my twitter for anything urgent!
