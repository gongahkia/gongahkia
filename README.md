# Good morning [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqWqSxJtBDw&ab_channel=klantskalle) 🐱

👋🤡 Gabriel here.

I'm your *[average Neovim enthusiast](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/5_circus_clowns_LCCN2002718921.jpg)*, and particulary enjoy making tools and small games that run on the **command line**. Right now, I'm interested in gaining more experience in application and web development.

------

Currently practicing:
* C++
> Everyday I look into the mirror and try to convince myself that C++ is a lovely language when I have to create a whole-ass void function to use `.split()` 💞️

Versed in: 
* Python
* C
* Nim
* Bash 
* Javascript, HTML and CSS

------

I’m looking to collaborate on anything app or web dev related, though I'll likely be more of support for back-end related stuff rather than front-end.  

For anything urgent, you can drop me a message on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-ong-a87022208/).
