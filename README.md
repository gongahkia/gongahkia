- 👋 Gabriel here.
- 👀 I’m interested application and web development.
- 🌱 Currently practicing Go, Kotlin and C. Versed in Python, Javascript, C++, HTML, and CSS. Julia, Rust, Perl, and Ruby are all on the backburner for now.
- 🤡 Deluding myself into believing C++ will make me a better programmer when I have to create a whole ass void function to use .split()
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything app or web dev related, though I'll likely be more of support for back-end related stuff.
- 📫 You can reach me on my twitter for anything urgent!
